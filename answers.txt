What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge creates a “merge commit” that joins the development histories of the 
two sequences being merged, so the branches are not changed. On the other 
hand, rebase reconfigures the history to include the new branch’s commits 
over the ones of the base branch. This results in a linear project 
history, which is much cleaner. Essentially, merge preserves development 
history but rebase rewrites it.
